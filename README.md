# Data_Rehovot
Dataset used in the manuscript "A lifetime track of a griffon vulture: the moving story of Rehovot (Y64)"

# Open research statement
Data supporting this research are sensitive and not available publicly due to the endangered status of the focal species in the study region. The data contains GPS locations of the focal individual and are available in the Movebank study “E-obs Gsm Vultures Israel” (Movebank ID 7359070) to qualified researchers. Requests must be sent to Orr Spiegel, School of Zoology, Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel Aviv University (orrspiegel@tauex.tau.ac.il). An anonymized version of the dataset will be available upon acceptance on GitHub (https://github.com/Orrslab/Data_Rehovot). This data was shifted a few kms from its original location to ensure the species safety, but maintains all other geometrical attributes needed for reconstructing the analysis.
